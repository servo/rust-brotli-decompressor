description = "A brotli decompressor that with an interface avoiding the rust stdlib. This makes it suitable for embedded devices and kernels. It is designed with a pluggable allocator so that the standard lib's allocator may be employed. The default build also includes a stdlib allocator and stream interface. Disable this with --features=no-stdlib. Alternatively, --features=unsafe turns off array bounds checks and memory initialization but provides a safe interface for the caller.  Without adding the --features=unsafe argument, all included code is safe. For compression in addition to this library, download https://github.com/dropbox/rust-brotli "
